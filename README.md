# Project-One
This is project one for coding bootcamp

This was a group project with students from our coding bootcamp. We desided to create somewhat of a Yelp Clone. 
Using the Yelp API the user can search for any topic in any city and state and get ten results back. 
Using the Google Maps API we then display the entered city and state and place a marker for each Yelp result.
